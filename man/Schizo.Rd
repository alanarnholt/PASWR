\description{
Twenty-five patients with schizophrenia were classified as psychotic or
nonpsychotic after being treated with an antipsychotic drug.  Samples of
cerebral fluid were taken from each patient and assayed for dopamine
b-hydroxylase (DBH) activity. The dopamine measurements for the two groups
are in nmol/(ml)(h)/(mg) of protein.
