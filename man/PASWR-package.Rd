and engineering-oriented, \emph{Probability and Statistics with R} provides
a thorough treatment of probability and statistics, clear and accessible
real-world examples, and fully detailed proofs.  The text provides
step-by-step explanations for numerous examples in R and S-PLUS for nearly
every topic covered, including both traditional and nonparametric
techniques. With a wide range of graphs to illustrate complex material as

other downloadable material. It is ideal for undergraduate students and for
engineers and scientists who must perform statistical analyses.
