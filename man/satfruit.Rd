\description{
To estimate the total surface occupied by fruit trees in 3 small areas (R63,
R67, and R68) of Navarra (Spain) in 2001, a sample of 47 square segments has
been taken. The experimental units are square segments or quadrats of 4
hectares, obtained by random sampling after overlaying a square grid on the
study domain.  Data are used in Case Study: Fruit Trees, Chapter 12.
