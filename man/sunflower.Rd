\description{
Seventy-two field trials were conducted by applying four defoliation
treatments (non defoliated control, 33\%, 66\%, and 100\%) at different
growth stages (\code{stage}) ranging from pre-flowering (1) to physiological
maturity (5) in four different locations of Navarra, Spain: Carcastillo (1),
Melida (2), Murillo (3), and Unciti (4). There are two response variables:
\code{yield} in kg/ha of the sunflower and \code{numseed}, the number of
seeds per sunflower head. Data are stored in the data frame
\code{sunflower}.  Data used in Case Study: Sunflower defoliation from
Chapter 11.
