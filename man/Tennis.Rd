\description{
The Yonalasee tennis club has two systems to measure the speed of a tennis
ball. The local tennis pro suspects one system (Speed1) consistently records
faster speeds. To test her suspicions, she sets up both systems and records
the speeds of 12 serves (three serves from each side of the court). The
values are stored in the data frame \code{Tennis} in the variables
\code{Speed1} and \code{Speed2}. The recorded speeds are in kilometers per
hour.
